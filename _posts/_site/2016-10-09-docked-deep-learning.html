<p><em>Dear Diary,<br />
I have lost around <strong>16 working hours</strong> on trying to set up caffe deep
learning framework on Ubuntu 16.04. I am currently on the 9th level of
dependency hell, and there is no light at the end of the tunnel. There is
no tunnel either. Because you have held broken packages.</em></p>

<h2 id="doing-it-yourself">Doing it yourself</h2>
<p>Hands-on experience tops every other learning method. Therefore it makes
sense to start working with higher-level frameworks/libraries as soon as
you feel you’ve conquered nuts and bolts of
<a href="/posts/2016/09/24/machine-learning-immersion/">machine learning foundations</a>.</p>

<p>But before you dive in and type all the research papers away, process of
installation can get awfully bad.</p>

<p>It can get n-wasted-hours bad. Or even worse, you somehow manage to
scrape it together, but you feel bad because you’ve just entered fifteen
semi-familiar commands and partially bloated your system since five
didn’t work.</p>

<h2 id="the-time-consuming-way">The time-consuming way</h2>
<p>Install everything by reading official docs. Sometimes building from
source. lol</p>

<p>Questions I forgot to ask myself while I did this:<br />
 - Do you really want all that extra software on your host machine?<br />
 - What if you wanted to do same experiment/project somewhere else?<br />
   Installing everything again?<br />
 - If so what about host-specific configs needed on other machines?</p>

<h2 id="docking-the-install">Docking the install</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> is this fantastic tool that efficiently allows you to isolate
your dev environments from the host machine(s).</p>

<p>I have started using it just a few days ago to install <strong>all major DL frameworks at
once</strong>, so I am no expert but I already see many benefits.</p>

<p>Docker terminology:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Dockerfile</strong><br />
  A text document that has all commands needed to build <em>the image</em>. It’s
  the recipe on how to create the image and what dependencies to install.</li>
  <li><strong>Image</strong><br />
  Docker <em>image</em> is built by dockerfile. It’s an immutable template that has
  all dependencies and can be instantiated as <em>container</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Container</strong><br />
  The container is a lightweight, self-contained environment that is instantiated
  from an image and can be accessed via terminal/GUI. You can easily setup shared
  folder between host and container, open ports for ipython notebooks or just use
  terminal directly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Having clear idea of the concepts above, following through this
<a href="https://github.com/saiprashanths/dl-docker">awesome README</a> you’ll get Tensorflow-Caffe-Theano-Keras-Lasagne-Torch-enabled
machine up and running in no time.</p>

<p>You may also find useful this <a href="https://github.com/wsargent/docker-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md">beautiful cheatsheet</a> that has many
useful docker commands which can help your docker-fu.</p>
