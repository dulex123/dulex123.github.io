*This page will not try to explain what LSTM is or how it works. For that you can check colah's blog and deeplearningbook, instead this will be a guide on how to perform a cell backprop for LSTM.*

***Notice:** It's recommended that you try to do the exercise on your own, only if you've tried your best should you proceed.*
