# Hi there!  

My name is Dušan Josipović. I am a machine learning enthusiast and I have been [studying](/2016/machine-learning-immersion) the subject of Deep Learning for the past few months.

You can find some of my code on [github](https://github.com/dulex123).

I often post ML related stuff on [twitter](https://twitter.com/josipovicd).

There are three categories of posts here:

- **Experiments**: Something I am building with little previous experience
- **Schemes**: Short and simple helper apps  
- **Posts**: Regular posts mostly about machine learning stuff
